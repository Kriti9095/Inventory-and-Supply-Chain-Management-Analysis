# Inventory & Supply Chain Dashboard

## About the Project
This project is focused on understanding how inventory and supply chain operations are performing across different regions and product categories. The idea was to analyze stock levels, warehouse usage, order fulfillment, and transportation costs and convert raw data into clear, actionable insights.

The dashboard is designed to help identify inefficiencies in inventory distribution, logistics costs, and warehouse utilization.

## Tools Used
- MS Excel – Used as the initial data source, data cleaning  
- MySQL – Used for storing data and  querying    
- Power BI – Used for building an interactive dashboard with slicers, filters, dynamic KPIs  

---

## Key Metrics Tracked
- **Warehouse Utilization:** 34.08%  
- **Days Sales of Inventory (DSI):** 15.56 days  
- **Inventory Turnover Ratio:** 23.47  
- **Average Lead Time:** ~15–16 days  

These KPIs help evaluate how efficiently inventory is being managed and how quickly it is converted into sales.

---

## What the Dashboard Shows
- Transportation costs broken down by **region** and **product category**
- Year-wise sales trend, showing a sharp rise from 2022 onwards
- Average lead time comparison across categories
- Order status split into **Fulfilled, Pending, and Cancelled**
- Inventory distribution across regions and categories

---

## Key Observations
- Sales volume increased significantly after 2021 and stayed consistently high through 2023–2024, indicating stable demand.
- Warehouse utilization is relatively low (34.08%), which suggests a large portion of capacity is currently unused.
- Transportation costs are noticeably higher in the West region, especially for Furniture.
- While most backorders are fulfilled, a considerable number of orders remain pending, which could lead to cancellations if not addressed.
- Inventory levels are higher in the East and North regions, aligning with demand patterns in those areas.

---

## Business Takeaways
- The low DSI and high inventory turnover indicate that inventory is moving quickly, which is good from a cost perspective.
- Under-utilized warehouse space presents an opportunity to scale inventory, expand product lines, or optimize warehouse usage.
- Logistics costs can potentially be reduced by re-evaluating transportation strategies in high-cost regions.
- Improving fulfillment speed for pending orders, especially in high-demand categories, can help reduce cancellation risks.

---

## Dashboard Interactivity
- Region and category-based filters for focused analysis
- Order status slicers to track fulfillment performance
- Dynamic KPIs that update with filter selection
- Drill-down enabled visuals for deeper insights
